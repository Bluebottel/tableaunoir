# tableaunoir

Tableaunoir is an online blackboard tool. It can be used as a traditional blackboard but you can also create interactive animations via the use of "fridge magnets".
"Tableau noir" means blackboard in french. The online version is available here:

## Example of use

Tableaunoir is used for teaching at ENS Rennes. The main advantage is that the screen is fully black: there are no buttons that annoy the students. Tableaunoir is controlled by a graphic tablet by the keyboard of the computer (7 keys!). It makes it very interactive compared to fixed slides.
